	<!-- TO DO: 
	1. I should change this so that the company doesn't have to reenter their id. Try to use factory solution, as seen here:
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21919962/share-data-between-angularjs-controllers
	2. Add "Welcome, Company Name"
	3. Only the company that logged in should be able to update their own password!!
